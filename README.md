# Koopman:
A deep learning library for global and exact linearisation of non-linear systems.

## Why Koopman?

1. Future-state prediction:

The problem of future-state prediction for non-linear systems is non-trivial.

2. Automated Model Discovery:

By approximating Koopman Operators with machine learning, we discover parsimonious
models that generalise. This allows us to test important hypotheses that could
not be formulated otherwise using less principled machine learning methods.

3. Robust control of complex systems:

The exact and global linearisation of non-linear systems allows us to leverage
powerful and principled methods for controlling linear systems.

## Examples:

1. Global linearisation of the Lorenz system:

  a. Approximate Koopman operator for future-state prediction, 2-5 time increments into the future. On average, ~0.10 Mean Squared Error on test set.

  b. Code: (1) [Simulated data for the Lorenz system](https://github.com/AidanRocke/Koopman/blob/main/Lorenz_system/simulated_data.py), (2) [Model training and evaluation](https://github.com/AidanRocke/Koopman/blob/main/Lorenz_system/lorenz_koopman.py).
